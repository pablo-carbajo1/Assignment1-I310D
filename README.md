This project talks about the number of hours that students at the University of Texas at Austin took during the Fall 2020 semester. The main goal of this project is to see the different number of hours students were enrolled in during this semester. In this project, I also compare the number of hours students were enrolled in based on their gender.

This project's data is under an MIT license and the data was obtained from UT's statistial handbook (https://utexas.app.box.com/s/gflzag1a3f88jelotrdv9uendvmdf1kt). The data that I used is on page 12 of this handbook. In order to get more information, I also led a poll asking 20 seniors the number of hours that they took during the Fall 2020 semester.

However, the data might be inaccurate because I used 20 responses on the poll, which is not a big enough sample to properly represent the actual percentages and numbers of hours that students were enrolled in during that semester.
